# African Leadership University - Random Recipe Generator

This project is a web application that generates random recipes using the MealDB API. It provides a user-friendly interface to discover new meal ideas, view recipe details, and explore a selection of random recipes.

## Features

-   **Random Recipe on Load:** The home page (`index.html`) displays a random recipe when it's loaded.
-   **Get Another Random Recipe:** A button on the home page allows users to fetch and display a new random recipe.
-   **10 Random Recipes:** A button on the home page navigates users to the `recipes.html` page, which displays 10 random recipes.
-   **Recipe Details:** Each recipe on the 10 random recipes page links to a detailed view (`details.html`).
-   **Comprehensive Recipe Information:** The details page includes:
    -   Recipe title and image
    -   Ingredients with corresponding measurements and images
    -   Cooking instructions
    -   Recipe category, area, and tags
    -   Link to a YouTube tutorial (if available)
-   **Search Recipe:** A text input on every page allows the users to find their favorite recipe by name
-   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes.
-   **Error Handling:** The application handles API errors gracefully and displays user-friendly messages.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Vanilla JavaScript
-   MealDB API (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

## API Usage

This application uses the MealDB API to fetch recipe data. The following endpoints are used:

-   `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php`: To fetch a single random recipe.
-   `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i={recipe_id}`: To fetch detailed recipe information.
-   Since the free MealDB API does not provide a true random selection endpoint, 10 calls to `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php` are made to generate 10 random recipes.

## Deployment

- https://recipes.bruceshimwa.tech points to the load balancer and distributes traffic using a round robbin algorithm.
- i added a virtual server to my web servers to listen for https://recipes.bruceshimwa.tech domain and point to my recipes code's directory
- my nginx configuration allows me to still have my resume https://bruceshimwa.tech and the recipes website on the same server.
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name bruceshimwa.tech www.bruceshimwa.tech;
    error_page 404 /404.html;
    add_header X-Served-By $hostname;

    location = /404.html {
        root /var/www/html;
    }

    location / {
	root /home/ubuntu/alu-responsive-resume/;
    }

    location /redirect_me {
        return 301 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name recipes.bruceshimwa.tech;
    add_header X-Served-By $hostname;

    location / {
        root /home/ubuntu/alu-recipe-web/;
    }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

- Scrapping the web for a useful API that matches the rubrics criteria
- testing the API to see if it works fine, some APIs didn't work
- dealing with images with this api like displaying and fetching them.

## Future Improvements

-   Implement user authentication to save favorite recipes.
-   Improve search functionality to find recipes by ingredients not just by name.
-   Improve the UI/UX with more interactive elements.
-   Add more advanced filtering options.
-   Add unit tests.
-   Add a recipe rating system.
-   But this is just a school assignment! ðŸ˜‚
